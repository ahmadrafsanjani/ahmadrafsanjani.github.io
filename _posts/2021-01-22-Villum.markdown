I am thrilled to be among this year's Villum Young Investigators to create a snake-inspired soft robot that can learn to crawl and navigate through narrow passages. I am grateful to the Villum Foundation and honored for being part of this community. The DKK 6M grant funds a PhD student, a postdoctoral researcher and equipment.

I am thrilled to be among this year's Villum Young Investigators to create a snake-inspired soft robot that can learn to crawl and navigate through narrow passages. I am grateful to the [<u>Villum Foundation</u>](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en/19-new-villum-young-investigators-in-2021){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and honored for being part of this community. The DKK 6M grant funds a PhD student, a postdoctoral researcher and equipment.
